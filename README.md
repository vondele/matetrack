#  Track the evolution of Stockfish mate finding effectiveness 

Track the performance of [official Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
in finding the (best) mates within the 6555 mate problems in [`matetrack.epd`](matetrack.epd).
The raw data is available in [`matetrack1000000.csv`](matetrack1000000.csv),
and is visualized in the graphs below.

### Usage of `matecheck.py`

```
usage: matecheck.py [-h] [--engine ENGINE] [--nodes NODES] [--depth DEPTH] [--time TIME] [--mate MATE] [--hash HASH] [--threads THREADS] [--syzygyPath SYZYGYPATH] [--minTBscore MINTBSCORE] [--concurrency CONCURRENCY] [--epdFile EPDFILE [EPDFILE ...]] [--showAllIssues] [--shortTBPVonly] [--showAllStats] [--bench]

Check how many (best) mates an engine finds in e.g. matetrack.epd, a file with lines of the form "FEN bm #X;".

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --engine ENGINE       name of the engine binary (default: ./stockfish)
  --nodes NODES         nodes limit per position, default: 10**6 without other limits, otherwise None (default: None)
  --depth DEPTH         depth limit per position (default: None)
  --time TIME           time limit (in seconds) per position (default: None)
  --mate MATE           mate limit per position: a value of 0 will use bm #X as the limit, a positive value (in the absence of other limits) means only elegible positions will be analysed (default: None)
  --hash HASH           hash table size in MB (default: None)
  --threads THREADS     number of threads per position (values > 1 may lead to non-deterministic results) (default: None)
  --syzygyPath SYZYGYPATH
                        path(s) to syzygy EGTBs, with ':'/';' as separator on Linux/Windows (default: None)
  --minTBscore MINTBSCORE
                        lowest cp score for a TB win (default: 19754)
  --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                        total number of threads script may use, default: cpu_count() (default: 8)
  --epdFile EPDFILE [EPDFILE ...]
                        file(s) containing the positions and their mate scores (default: ['matetrack.epd'])
  --showAllIssues       show all unique UCI info lines with an issue, by default show for each FEN only the first occurrence of each possible type of issue (default: False)
  --shortTBPVonly       for TB win scores, only consider short PVs an issue (default: False)
  --showAllStats        show nodes and depth statistics for best mates found (always True if --mate is supplied) (default: False)
  --bench               provide cumulative statistics for nodes searched and time used (ignoring upper/lower bound UCI info lines) (default: False)
```

Sample output:
```
Using ./sf16 on matetrack.epd with --nodes 10000
Engine ID:     Stockfish 16
Total FENs:    6555
Found mates:   524
Best mates:    355

Parsing the engine's full UCI output, the following issues were detected:
Bad PVs:       600   (from 351 FENs)
```

Note that the mate counts are out of the total number of FENs, while the
reported issues cover all the UCI output lines received from the engine.
Here a "bad" PV may mean that it is too short, too long, allows a draw,
contains illegal moves or does not end in checkmate.

### List of available test suites

* `ChestUCI_23102018.epd`: The original suite derived from publicly available `ChestUCI.epd` files, see [FishCooking](https://groups.google.com/g/fishcooking/c/lh1jTS4U9LU/m/zrvoYQZUCQAJ). It contains 6561 positions, with one draw, four positions that are likely draws due to the 50 move rule, some illegal positions and some positions with a sub-optimal or likely incorrect value for the fastest known mate.
* **`matetrack.epd`**: The successor to `ChestUCI_23102018.epd`, with all illegal positions removed and all known errors corrected. The plots shown above are based on this file. It contains 6555 mate problems, ranging from mate in 1 (#1) to #126 for positions with between 4 and 32 pieces. In 26 positions the side to move is going to get mated.
* `matetrackpv.epd`: The same as `matetrack.epd`, but for each position the file also includes a PV leading to the checkmate, if such a PV is known.
* `matedtrack.epd`: Derived from `matetrackpv.epd` by applying a best move in all those positions, where the winning side is to move, and where a best move is known. The order of the positions in `matedtrack.epd` corresponds 1:1 to the order in `matetrack.epd`. So the new test suite still contains 6555 mate problems, but for 6540 of them the side to move is going to get mated.
* `mates2000.epd`: A smaller test suite with 2000 positions ranging from #1 to #27. It contains a random selection of positions from `matetrack.epd` and `matedtrack.epd` that Stockfish can solve with 1M nodes. In 1105 positions the side to move is going to get mated.

### Automatic creation of new test positions

With the help of the script `advancepvs.py` it is easy to derive new mate
puzzles from the information stored in `matetrackpv.epd`. For example, the file `matedtrack.epd` has been created with the command
```shell
python advancepvs.py --plies 1 --mateType won && sed 's/; PV.*/;/' matedtrackpv.epd > matedtrack.epd
```
Similarly, a file with only `#-10` positions can be created with the command
```shell
python advancepvs.py --targetMate -10 && grep 'bm #-10;' matedtrackpv.epd > mate-10.epd
```
